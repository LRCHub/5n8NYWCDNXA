I got no time
I got nowhere to go
Saw you in the clouds
Found you
Looking at this tide
Found you on the right side
All of a sudden
There were you
There you are
There you are
There you are
There you are
I miss the sunshine
I can't see sunrise
Like we're out of time
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
Looking at this tide
Found you on the right side
All of a sudden
There were you
There you are
There you are
There you are
There you are
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
